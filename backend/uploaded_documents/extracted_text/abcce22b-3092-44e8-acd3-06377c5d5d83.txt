Article 1 - Member Life Insurance 
 
a. 
Actively at Work 
 
A Member's effective date for Member Life Insurance will be as explained in this article, if 
the Member is Actively at Work on that date.  If the Member is not Actively at Work on 
the date insurance would otherwise be effective, such insurance will not be in force until 
the day of return to Active Work. 
 
However, this Actively at Work requirement will be waived for Members who: 
 
(1) are absent from Active Work because of a regularly scheduled day off, holiday, or 
vacation day; and 
(2) were Actively at Work on their last scheduled work day before the date of their 
absence; and 
(3) were capable of Active Work on the day before the scheduled effective date of their 
insurance or change in their insurance, whichever is applicable. 
 
This Actively at Work requirement may also be waived as described below. 
 
When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Active 
Work requirement may be waived for those Members who: 
 
(1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and

In no event will the Active Work requirement be waived for those Members who, on the

the Prior Policy to an individual policy; or 
(2) were eligible under the terms of the Prior Policy, to have their premiums waived due 
to ADL Disability or Total Disability. 
 
NOTE:  When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy 
and the Active Work requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the 
Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the 
Prior Policy had it remained in force.

a. 
insurance ceased because of layoff or approved leave of absence; and 
 
b. 
the Member returns to Active Work for the Policyholder within six months of the date

determining the length of his or her continuous coverage under this Group Policy.  For this 
purpose the period of time during which a reinstated Member's insurance was not in force: 
 
a. 
will not be considered an interruption of continuous coverage; and 
 
b.

continuous coverage. 
 
In addition, a longer reinstatement period may be allowed for an approved leave of absence taken

coverage on the day immediately following completion of the 30 consecutive days of 
Active Work; and 
 
c. 
in the case of the Dependent, he or she remains in the United States for 30 consecutive 
days.  If the Dependent does so, he or she will be eligible for reinstatement of coverage on 
the day after completion of the 30 consecutive days of residence. 
 
The reinstated coverage will be on the same basis as that being provided on the date coverage is 
reinstated.  However, any restrictions on this coverage that were in effect before reinstatement

*The Scheduled Benefit is subject to the Proof of Good Health requirements as shown in PART 
III, Section B, Article 1.  Because of the Proof of Good Health requirements, the amount of 
insurance approved by The Principal may be different than the Scheduled Benefit.  If the 
approved amount of insurance is different than the Scheduled Benefit, the approved amount will 
apply.

Member's death, the Death Benefits Payable may be withheld until additional information has 
been received or the trial has been held. 
 
If a Member who was insured dies within the 31-day individual purchase period described in 
PART III, Section F, The Principal will pay his or her beneficiary the individual policy amount, 
if any, the Member had the right to purchase. 
 
No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death. 
 
 
Article 3 - Beneficiary 
 
A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy.  
A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The 
Principal.  A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal.  Once recorded, the 
change will apply as of the date the request was Signed.  If The Principal properly pays any 
benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested.  Further: 
 
a. 
The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, 
Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group 
Policy. 
 
b. 
If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded 
on the date of termination. 
 
If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces 
insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in 
such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the 
beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named.

Principal to the full extent of those payments.

from receiving any benefit due.  Payment may then be made to any contingent beneficiary 
or to the executor or administrator of the Member's estate. 
 
b. 
Any benefit due a beneficiary who dies before the Member's death will be paid in equal 
shares to the Member's surviving beneficiaries.

c. 
If a beneficiary dies at the same time or within 15 days after the Member dies, but before 
The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death, payment will be made as if the 
Member survived the beneficiary. 
 
d. 
If no beneficiary survives the Member or if the Member has not named a beneficiary, 
payment will be made in the following order of precedence as numbered: 
 
(1) to the Member's spouse;

by The Principal, for a payment, and no guardian has been appointed, The Principal may 
pay whoever has assumed the care and support of the person. 
 
 
Article 5 - Settlement of Proceeds 
 
When The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death, the Scheduled Benefit (or 
approved amount, if applicable) in force for the Member, less any Accelerated Benefit payment 
as described in PART IV, Section A, Article 7 will be placed in an interest-bearing draft account 
at an interest rate determined by The Principal, unless a lump sum or other settlement option has 
been elected.  With the interest-bearing draft account, the balance will be available to the 
beneficiary at any time, in total or in part, subject to the following terms: 
 
a. 
withdrawals must be made by draft furnished by The Principal; and 
 
b. 
the draft amount must be at least $500 or more and may not exceed the account balance; 
and 
 
c. 
if the account balance falls below $500, the balance will be paid to the beneficiary in a 
lump sum and the account closed; and 
 
d. 
the account cannot be assigned or used as collateral. 
 
The Interest Draft Account will not be available if the Scheduled Benefit amount payable is 
$5,000 or less; or if the beneficiary is anything other than a natural person.  In these instances, a 
lump sum payment will be made. 
 
In the event the Interest Draft Account is not available or otherwise does not apply, The Principal 
reserves the right to make payment of proceeds according to other settlement options if agreed 
to, in Writing, by The Principal.

The Principal may require that a ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled Member be examined 
by a Physician or undergo an evaluation, at reasonable intervals, during the course of a 
claim.  After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued two years from the date first 
proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is received, examinations or evaluations may 
not be required more than once each year. 
 
The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the 
Physician or evaluator to perform them.  Failure to attend a medical examination or 
cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits.  Failure to 
attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the 
Member's benefits.  If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any 
charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her 
responsibility. 
 
d. 
Effective Dates and Premium Waiver 
 
Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: 
 
(1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or 
(2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or

Premium will not be charged for Member Life and Member Accidental Death and 
Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance while the Member's Coverage 
During Disability is in force. 
 
e. 
Benefits Payable 
 
If death occurs while Coverage During Disability is in force, The Principal will pay the 
Member's beneficiary the Member Life Insurance benefit amount that would have been 
paid had the Member remained insured under the Schedule of Insurance in force on the 
date Total Disability began. 
 
Such benefit shall be subject to any reduction provided under the Schedule of Insurance. 
 
However, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAID if Written proof of ADL Disability or Total 
Disability is not sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total 
Disability began. Failure to give Written proof within the time specified will not invalidate 
or reduce any claim if Written proof is given as soon as reasonably possible. Further, if a 
death benefit is paid under this section of the Group Policy, it will be in place of all other 
Member Life Insurance benefits provided under this Group Policy.

*The Scheduled Benefit is subject to the Proof of Good Health requirements as shown in PART

insurance approved by The Principal may be different than the Scheduled Benefit.  If the 
approved amount of insurance is different than the Scheduled Benefit, the approved amount will 
apply.

Benefit amount.  If a Member elects a Dependent Life benefit in excess of 50% of the Member's

    Section C - Dependent Life Insurance, Page 2 
 
If a Dependent who was insured dies during the 31-day individual purchase period described in 
PART III, Section F, Article 2, The Principal will pay the individual policy amount, if any, the 
Dependent had the right to purchase. 
 
Unless a Beneficiary has been designated, payment will be to the Member if he or she survives 
the Dependent.  If the Member does not survive the Dependent and a beneficiary for Dependent 
Life has not been named, payment will be to the person named as beneficiary for Member Life 
Insurance.  However, if the Member is suspected or charged with the Dependent's death, the 
Death Benefits Payable may be withheld until additional information has been received or the 
trial has been held.  If the Member is found guilty of the Dependent's death, he or she may be 
disqualified from receiving any benefit due.  Payment may then be made to the executor or 
administrator of the Dependent's estate.  Payment will be subject to the Beneficiary provisions in 
Article 3 and the Facility of Payment and Settlement of Proceeds provisions of PART IV,

benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested.

Section D - Claim Procedures 
 
 
Article 1 - Notice of Claim 
 
Written notice must be sent to The Principal by or for a Member or Dependent who wishes to file 
claim for benefits under this Group Policy.  This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date 
of the loss for which claim is being made.  Failure to give notice within the time specified will 
not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. 
 
 
Article 2 - Claim Forms 
 
The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing 
proof of loss.  If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, 
the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon 
submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the 
occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. 
 
 
Article 3 - Proof of Loss 
 
Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss.  
Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss.  The Principal may request 
additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain 
that information from the provider.  Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could 
result in declination of the claim.  For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing 
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be 
considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. 
 
 
Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review 
 
ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim.  If a claim cannot 
be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior 
to the expiration of the 45 days.  The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all 
additional information requested.  The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for 
processing an incomplete claim.  Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the 
extension. 
 
In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The 
Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss.  Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot 
be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.

Section D - Claim Procedures, Page 2 
 
A claimant may request an appeal of a claim denial by Written request to The Principal within 
180 days of receipt of notice of the denial.  The Principal will make a full and fair review of the 
claim.  The Principal may require additional information to make the review.  The Principal will 
notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal 
request.  If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did 
not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension 
for the review.  Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension.  After 
exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal.  
However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal 
action. 
 
For purposes of this section, "claimant" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. 
 
 
Article 5 - Medical Examinations 
 
The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be 
examined by a Physician during the course of a claim.  The Principal will pay for these 
examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. 
 
 
Article 6 - Autopsy 
 
If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy.  The Principal will 
pay for any such autopsy. 
 
 
Article 7 - Legal Action 
 
Legal action to recover benefits under this Group Policy may not be started earlier than 90 days 
after required proof of loss has been filed and before the appeal procedures have been exhausted.  
Further, no legal action may be started later than three years after that proof is required to be 
filed. 
 
 
Article 8 - Time Limits 
 
Any time limits in this section will be adjusted as required by law.
